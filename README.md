# HealthcareProject
This project performs exploratory data analysis on a diabetes-related dataset to examine the distribution of health variables and identify key relationships associated with diabetes risk. The analysis includes univariate, bivariate, and multivariate techniques to explore patterns between BMI, glucose levels, blood pressure, physical activity, and demographic factors. Strong associations were observed between fasting glucose and HbA1c, along with moderate relationships between BMI and blood pressure. The project uses Python with Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Jupyter Notebook to generate insights and visualizations that support further health risk analysis and modeling.
